This project represents the collaborative efforts of Fatima Asif and Aroush Qureshi.

The initial few commits involved the development of a fundamental, personalized HTML website, adhering solely to 
frontend principles. It is an online modest clothing brand called "A&F Boutique".

Subsequently, we progressed to the creation of a comprehensive E-Commerce platform, seamlessly integrating both 
backend and frontend functionalities. Leveraging advanced technologies such as Flask and React, in conjunction with
foundational web languages including HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, we engineered a sophisticated and fully operational 
website. It is simple, yet efficient.
